- The file overwrite handler is severely broken in some unknown cases.
	Wictor Olseryd informs me that npretty overwrote all files it was _not_
	supposed to overwrite, and skipped those it was supposed to overwrite!

- Template parsing is extremely crude. No testing had been done out of the scope
	of the example template, and if your template breaks somehow, I am
	probably already aware of the problem.
	
I had not planned for npretty to be distributed directly due to lack of time to
work on it, but it seems to have been packetised by some anyway.

That's all :).
