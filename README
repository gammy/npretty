Next Generation Pretty README.

WARNING: Please read BUGS for important information before using npretty!

npretty is a perl script which generates image galleries.
It can generate thumbnail and preview pages based on a template,
convert videos to gif89a(via mplayer), remove EXIF thumbnails and auto-rotate
images (via jhead), scale images with many different filters and much more.

Requirements
============
- Anything but Windows (fork won't work)
- Kernel threading support
- perl > 5.8.x (untested on anything lower)
- perl fork module
- Image::ExifTool perl module
- Image::Magic
- Getopt::Long

Suggested dependencies
======================
mplayer with many codecs and gif89a output support (http://mplayerhq.hu)
display (comes with imagemagick) (http://www.imagemagick.org)
jhead (http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/)

Install
=======
If you don't have the required perl modules, the 'quick and dirty' way to
install them is to start up cpan and then:
cpan> force install forks
cpan> force install Image::ExifTool
cpan> force install Image::Magick

Agree to all dependencies cpan wants to get.
Assuming you have ImageMagick and forking support, this should work even
though it will spawn a lot of warnings and errors. 

create /etc/npretty/ and copy novideo.gif, npretty_template.tpl and npretty.conf
to it.

Then place npretty.pl in a fitting directory and make it executable:
as root,
   chmod +x npretty.pl
   cp npretty.pl /usr/local/bin

You should now be ready to go!

Usage
=====

There are too many ways to use npretty for me to describe them all here.
Usually, something like
	npretty.pl --image-path=/path/to/images/ --destination=/my/destination/
should be a good start.

Template
========
The template file consists of blocks, subblocks and tags.

Blocks
------
There are three major blocks:
	[NPRETTY_BLOCK_THUMB]
	[NPRETTY_BLOCK_BODY] and
	[NPRETTY_BLOCK_PREVIEW]
The THUMB block contains all initial and final HTML for thumbnail pages.
The BODY block contains HTML code containing and surrounding each thumbnail
image.
The PREVIEW block contains all HTML for preview pages.
Each BLOCK is closed by an identical block tag with a \/ prepended before the
bracket. For example,
  [NPRETTY_BLOCK_BODY] HTML here [/NPRETTY_BLOCK_BODY]

Subblocks
---------
The major blocks contain subblocks and tags.
Subblocks work the same as the major blocks, but are 
mostly formed on a 'if exists'-basis.

The subblocks are:
	In THUMB block:
		[NPRETTY_LIST]
		[NPRETTY_LIST_IFSEL]
		[NPRETTY_PREV_EXIST]
		[NPRETTY_PREV_NOEXIST]
		[NPRETTY_NEXT_EXIST]
		[NPRETTY_NEXT_NOEXIST]
		[NPRETTY_COMMENT_EXIST]
		[NPRETTY_TITLE_EXIST]
		[NPRETTY_TITLE_NOEXIST]
	In BODY block:
		[NPRETTY_DEL<_n>]
		[NPRETTY_PAD_DEL]
	In PREVIEW block:
		[NPRETTY_PREV_LIST]
		[NPRETTY_PREV_LIST_IFSEL]
		[NPRETTY_PREV_IMG_EXIST]
		[NPRETTY_PREV_IMG_NOEXIST]
		[NPRETTY_NEXT_IMG_EXIST]
		[NPRETTY_NEXT_IMG_NOEXIST]
		[NPRETTY_COMMENT_EXIST]
		[NPRETTY_TITLE_EXIST]
		[NPRETTY_TITLE_NOEXIST]

Most of these should be self-explanatory, but there are a few odd ones.

The [NPRETTY_LIST] subblock specifies where and how you want to insert links to
thumbnail pages. If you have five thumbnail pages, the code inserted in this
subblock will be repeated five times, with the internal variables updated each
iteration. This allows you to design the layout for your link menu.

The [NPRETTY_PREV_LIST] is the same as [NPRETTY_LIST], but for preview pages.

The [NPRETTY_DEL<_n>] subblock specifies code to be inserted between every <n>
images. [NPRETTY_DEL_4] Hello! [/NPRETTY_DEL] would insert "Hello!" between
every 4 images, unless the last image is the 4th.

The [NPRETTY_PAD_DEL] subblock specifies code to be inserted as padding when
there are no more images on the page, but the delimiter count is uneven.
This is handy for properly ending a table, for example.

Tags
----
Tags are internal variables which will be replaced with dynamic data based on
the block and subblock in which the variable lies. There are several
inconsistencies here which I blame on my sloppy coding, but for the mostpart
it should work alright.

Tags				Replaced with
[NPRETTY_BODY]			contents of BODY block
[NPRETTY_TITLE]			set title
[NPRETTY_COMMENT]		set comment for current image
[NPRETTY_LIST_PAGE]		current page in iterator
[NPRETTY_LIST_NUM]		current page number in iterator
[NPRETTY_PREV_PAGE]		previous page (if possible)
[NPRETTY_PREV_PAGE_NUM]		previous page number (if possible)
[NPRETTY_NEXT_PAGE]		next page (if possible)
[NPRETTY_NEXT_PAGE_NUM]		next page number (if possible)
[NPRETTY_PREVIEW_PAGE]		preview page for image
[NPRETTY_THUMB]			thumbnail for image
[NPRETTY_SIZE]			filesize of original image
[NPRETTY_PAGE]			current page
[NPRETTY_PREV_LIST_PAGE]	current preview page in iterator
[NPRETTY_PREV_LIST_PAGE_NUM]	current preview page number in iterator
[NPRETTY_PREV_IMG]		current preview image
[NPRETTY_PREV_IMG_NAME]		current preview image name
[NPRETTY_NEXT_IMG]		next image (if possible)
[NPRETTY_NEXT_IMG_NAME]		next image name (if possible)
[NPRETTY_FILENAME]		current image filename
[NPRETTY_PREVIEW]		current preview image
[NPRETTY_EXIF_<element>]	EXIF-element <element>

How to use these would be a mess to document, and I'm not good at writing.
Have a look at the default template file to see a good example of how it
all works.
